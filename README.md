# Task 3 - Iris Flowers Classification
This repository contains a machine learning model for classifying Iris flowers into different species based on their features. The Iris dataset is a commonly used dataset for learning classification techniques, and this project demonstrates how to create and evaluate a classification model using Python.

---

## Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from three different species of Iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Each sample has four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and a corresponding target label indicating the species.

## Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you need:
* Python 3.x
* scikit-learn
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib (for visualization)
* seaborn
